# Haxchi

This is the continuation of the POC Haxchi exploit by smea.  
It features compatibility with a lot of DS VC and can be easly installed and further configured.

## Installation

Grab the current .elf from the release tab and put it into sd:/wiiu/apps so it can be run by the homebrew launcher later.  
For extras such as replaced icon, startup logo, startup sound, game title and button configuration download the "haxchi" archive and put its content into a folder on your sd called "sd:/haxchi". This folder will be used during installation to set up the game of your choice and you can adjust its content to your liking.  
The following games right now are supported by the installer:
